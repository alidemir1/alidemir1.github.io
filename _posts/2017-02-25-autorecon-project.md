In this project my role was to program robots. I was a project intern in the FCA (Fiat-Chrysler Automotive) in summer of 2014.
AutoRecon (AUTOnomous co-operative machines for highly RECONfigurable assembly operations of the future) was 7th Framework Programme project which was supported by EU. You can find the details in <a href="http://www.autorecon.eu" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

The automotive industry demonstrator which I am involved is in the following video;
