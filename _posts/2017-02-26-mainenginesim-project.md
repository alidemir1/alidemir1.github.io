In this project my task was to design algorithms which is mainly based on the dynamic models of the systems 
and interaction of those systems with each other. I was R&D Engineer in <a href="http://www.gdsarge.com/" rel="nofollow">GDS (Global Dynamics System) ARGE</a>.
The corporation which was mainly founded in Texas / USA then moved to the Istanbul / Turkey. 

You can see the video of the simulator below (not all of it, since it is still under development. I have worked on 
this project from 11/2014 to 09/2016). This project has been supported 
by BAP (Scientific Research Projects) Office of ITU (Istanbul Technical University). 
There are different systems under the same simulator but I thought that Main Engine is the one which is worth most to show.
By the way, this is the first Ship Main Engine and Subsystems Simulator developed in Turkey.
