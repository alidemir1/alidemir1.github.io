### Machine Learning
Actually before starting to explain Q-Learning Algorithm. I would like to write things down about Machine Learning (ML) which we started to
hear more frequently from day to day. Applications of ML varying from Autonomous cars [1], [3] to visualizing/immitating what people see under 
effect of the hallucinatives [2] so, from **engineers** to **physcologists**, it is used in many different areas. But why are we hearing this now and not before. It is
actually not a new area of research, you can see an autonomous car based on ML [3] from 1989. In my perspective it is because 
it was too expensive computationally. It still is but not like in the 1980s. Of course not only this, 
also there was not enough data to train (teach) models in order to make them do what we want them to do. So ImageNet[4] was born and 
now we have data and higher computational powers in our hands than 1980s. So we can teach a car to drive itself, or make a robot to "watch
and learn" like we do in our daily life. But don't worry they are not even close there to start a war against us :).
