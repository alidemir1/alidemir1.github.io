Tucker Detection Vision System (TDVS) is a software wihch allows its user to control existence of tuckers via computer vision.
My duty in the project was to improve algorithm, so that it is not effected by light variance. I have done this project while I was a project intern in 2014. 

###How System Works
The video is showing very shortly that the algorithm is working correctly and gives feedback about which tucker welding does not exist;

###Comparison of Two Algorithms
Here is the comparison of results of the two algorithms in the following picture (Left one is old and Right one is developed).

</figure>


In the picture, it is seen that we have detected not only tucker weldings but even the spot weldings which enabled us to use this
algorithm in varying areas in the factory.

Video of the comparison of algorithms in the video the first 30 seconds belongs to the old algorithm, and rest of the video shows the developed algorithm.;

and lastly mechanical design for production line (it might be seen insufficient but I have done this for only illustration purposes.)
