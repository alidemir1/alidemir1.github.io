### Machine Learning
I would like to write things down about Machine Learning (ML) which we started to hear more frequently from day to day. 
Applications of ML varying from Autonomous cars [1], [3] to visualizing/immitating what people see under 
effect of the hallucinatives [2] so, from **engineers** to **physcologists**, it is used in many different areas. 
But why are we hearing this now and not before. It is actually not a new area of research, you can see an autonomous car 
based on ML [3] from 1989. In my perspective it is because it was too expensive computationally. It still is but not like in the 1980s. 
Of course not only this,  also there was not enough data to train (teach) models in order to make them do what we want them to do. 
So ImageNet [4] was born and  now we have data and higher computational powers in our hands than 1980s. 
So we can teach a car to drive itself, or make a robot to "watch and learn" like we do in our daily life. 
But don't worry they are not even close there to start a war against us :).

###What Machine Learning Teaches Us
I actually thought on this most of the time when I think about machine learning, because the algorithms we implement make us understand how
we think, how actually human brain works. In this point, if we think about those algorithms common problems like overfitting (too dependent on the training data),
underfitting (can't even fit train data) etc. and to make ourselves more brilliant persons, we must also avoid from those errors, 
for example if we always read about one thing, we most likely overfit on that readings and can't understand or have a prejudice about 
thoughts from different perspectives, then we need to train ourselves with varying information. On the other hand we can also underfit
for example if we don't have enough information about something, and we have ideas about that same thing. Then these ideas most probably
are worng ideas. There is Turkish idiom for this situation "Akli yok, fikri var." which means "(One) has no brain, but ideas.". Those are
the ones that come to my mind now. But of course there are a lot to learn about both machine learning and human learning.

Stay with love.
