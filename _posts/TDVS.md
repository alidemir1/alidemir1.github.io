Tucker Detection Vision System (TDVS) is a software wihch allows its user to control existence of tuckers via computer vision.
My duty in the project was to improve algorithm, so that it is not effected by light variance. 

#How System Works
The video is showing very shortly that the algorithm is working correctly and gives feedback about which tucker welding does not exist;

Here is the comparison of results of the two algorithms in the following picture (Left one is old and Right one is developed).
