Aim of the project is to detect lanes with high accuracy and warn to driver in unintentional lane departures 
(like departure without using signal (blinker)) or wrong lane departures such as crossing over continous lane borders.
Project is still going on and what you can see in the video is the version of the original one after applied IPM (Inverse Perspective Mapping) in order to obtain lane borders as parallels. In the video blue circles are indicating lane departures, and the way of the departure (left or right) and you can hear some annoying sound which is there to warn driver.
