Aim of the project is to detect lanes with high accuracy and warn to driver in unintentional lane departures 
(like departure without using signal (blinker)) or wrong lane departures such as crossing over continous lane borders.
Project is still going on and what you can see in the video is the version of the original one after applied IPM (Inverse Perspective Mapping)
in order to obtain lane borders as parallels. So, video is only about lane detection and nothing there about warning or control. 
It is advised that speed video up 2 times in order to prevent time lost :).
